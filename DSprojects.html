         <p>  <u>  <a href=tab.html class='animation'> Apartment Web Scraper Dashboard </a>  </u> 
          
            This project web scrapes apartment data (price, # of beds, location) using Python (Beautiful Soup)
            for the 25 most populous cities in the US. The data is then cleaned and wrangled using Pandas into a single csv file. 
           Finally, a dashboard was created in Tableau to show a heat map of the median apartment rent as well as a horizontal bar graph 
          comparing the median rent to the median income for those cities.

        <p>  <u>  Volleyball Database SQL Project  </u> 
          
            This project demontrates my skill with SQL DDL as well as SQL queries by constructing a database managemnent system with 20+ 3NF normalized tables 
            representing elements such as Teams, Players, Coaches etc. After 100+ tuples are inserted a wide range of SQL queries can be executed such as
            updates, select, group by aggreate, division queries and more. </a>

        <p> <u> Forward and Backward Selection on idnetfying most effective variable for 'World Happiness score </u>  
         
            This was a group project with two other students in a upper-year Statistics class using Stepwise Selection to identify a variable that contributed most 
            to the World Happiness Index. The written report uilized statistical techniques such as correlation analysis, variable selection and model evaluation to
            present the findings to a mock team that could inform policy decisions.
